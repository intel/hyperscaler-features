# `Hyperscaler-Features` : A Feature Engineering Framework for e-Commerce Impressions Dataset

<div align="justify">
This repository contains a feature engineering framework that closely captures the scale, data types, and query
workloads of feature engineering pipelines at various large-scale companies.<br />
<br />
We narrow the scope to the e-Commerce scenario in TPC-DS and introduce User Browser History so that our data
generator can produce the interaction between features and user-behaviors within a user-session on a sequential
timeline.

### Requirements

The following `packages` are needed:
* Docker 25.0.3
* OpenJDK 1.8.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set up docker to run without sudo access. Please refer to this post-installation
  [**guide**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

The following `python packages` are needed:
* numpy
* sqlalchemy
* 'pyhive[presto]'
* pandas
* sql_formatter
* Minio
* pyarrow


### `Step 1` : Run node_setup.sh

```shell script
./node_setup.sh -i <install_path> [ -p <http_proxy_url:port> ]
```
`<install_path>` is the directory where we map volumes for various docker containers. We recommend
that this directory exist outside the repo.

`Optional` : Add proxy `<URL>:<port>` for docker containers using the `-p` flag.

Example:

```shell script
# If proxy is NOT required
./node_setup.sh -i <install_path>

# When proxy needs to be used
./node_setup.sh -i <install_path> -p http://proxy.example.com:3128
```

This results in the creation of four docker containers: 
* Postgresql
* hive
* MinIO
* Coordinator (presto)

These containers exist within a docker network (prestonet) and can communicate with each other. 


### `Step 2` : Run prepare.sh

* Creates the minio bucket corresponding to the scale factor.
* Generates sql queries inside `<working_dir>/framework/sfx/`. This directory is mapped to the
  presto docker container and can be accessed from within it.
* Generates the TPC-DS dataset and tables.
* Generates the click log dataset and queries based on the TPC-DS tables.
* Generates create and drop table sql query files for click log dataset. Save these files inside
`<working_dir>/framework/sfx/`.

```shell script
cd framework/
./prepare.sh -s <scale_factor> -l <install_path>
```

`<install_path>` is the same path as provided in Step 1.

`<scale_factor>` accepts integer values. `Scale factor = 1` means size of dataset is 1 GB. Usual values
are 1, 10, 100, ...


### `Step 3` : Create click log table and run other queries

Follow the steps below to create the partitioned `click_log_formatted` table from the generated log
files stored inside the MinIO S3 bucket. Currently these log files are generated in `parquet` (default)
or `csv` format.

```shell script
# Log into the presto docker container
docker exec -it coordinator /bin/bash

# Create the partitioned click log table
presto-cli --file /framework/sfx/create_click_log_table.sql

# Example: when scale factor = 1, replace sfx with sf1
presto-cli --file /framework/sf1/create_click_log_table.sql
```

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of the aforementioned `Step 3`, it is possible to run queries directly from `localhost` in the
> following way:
>
> ```shell script
> cd <install_path>/work
> ./run_query.sh framework/sfx/<sql_query_file>
>
> # Example: Create the click_log_formatted table for scale factor 1
> # ./run_query.sh framework/sf1/create_click_log_table.sql
> ```
